## 🔬 My Medical AI Journey

I’ve tried my hand at novel writing, music, YouTube content creation, and even stock trading—but none lit the spark like Medical AI. Now, I am currently focused on single cell BCR TCR, but I want to work in:

- **Computer Vision** for medical imaging (X-rays, MRIs, histopathology slides)  
- **Natural Language Processing** for clinical notes & care coordination  
- **Automated Medical Workflows** (from symptom triage to test ordering, result interpretation, and medication delivery)  
- **Wearable Integration** to bring continuous monitoring into the diagnostic loop  

My ultimate goal is to build a fully automated, end-to-end AI health platform that helps patients—especially in resource-limited settings—get timely diagnoses and treatment.

## 📚 Self-Learning & Progress

I’m using this space to log:

1. **Paper Implementations**  
   - Re-implementing classic and state-of-the-art models step by step  
2. **Reading Notes**  
   - Summaries of new research & foundational works  
3. **Tutorials & Mini-Projects**  
   - End-to-end demos, from data preprocessing to deployment  

> *“What gets measured, gets done.”*  
> By making my progress public, I stay accountable—and hopefully help others along the way!
